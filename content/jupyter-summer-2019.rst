:summary: Blog post on deploying JupyterHub on a Bare-Metal Kubernetes Cluster

Background
^^^^^^^^^^

As part of the `$5M grant <libretexts-grant.rst>`_ awarded to the LibreTexts
project, our team focused on creating a computing cluster running JupyterHub to
serve LibreTexts and UC Davis users. This quarter, we built a single-master cluster 
running JupyterHub and BinderHub.

Future
